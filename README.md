# Code Refactoring

## Outline

Horiseon is a social media marketing organization that specializes in Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. On their website clients will find a general overveiw of the main services they provide. Horiseon has requested that their existing code be modified to meet accessibility standards.

## The goal

Although the current webpage looks good on a browser, the existing HTML codebase consists of a multitude of divs that are not descriptive to the browser or to other developers. Along with that the CSS file contained multiple classes with identical attributes that are unnecessary. Finally, the page does not contain critical elements in order to meet accessibility standards.

Website accessibility is of utmost importance because it allows visitors that may have a disability an equal oppurtunity to have full access to the webpage. It also allows for a higher ranking in search egnines. 

## The solution

Existing code was restructured by replacing generic div elements with semantic HTML elements and condensing CSS selectors as well as adding comments to both HTML and CSS files so the code is easier to read for future development.
